# Mac Setup with Ansible + Claude Code

This Ansible playbook automates the setup of a Mac (fresh or existing) with a development environment, including applications, system preferences, Dock layout, and command-line tools. The automation is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times without causing issues. 

**ðŸ”„ Configuration Changes Are Reversible**: Shell, terminal, and most system preferences are automatically backed up before modification and can be restored. Installed applications remain on your system (not uninstalled during restore), and dock changes require manual restoration using the backup reference. 

See [what gets installed](#what-gets-installedconfigured) for the complete list, or [learn how to customize and run](#manual-clone-and-customization) with Claude Code.

## Quick Installation

Get started in seconds with these one-line commands. No need to clone the repository first.

### See What Would Change First (Recommended)
```bash
# Just see what would change (dry run)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithters/mac-setup/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --check-diff
```

### One-Line Setup Options
```bash
# Install prerequisites only
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithters/mac-setup/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --prerequisites

# Full automated setup (clone + install everything)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithters/mac-setup/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --full
```

## Manual Clone and Customization

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keithters/mac-setup.git
cd mac-setup
```

### Claude Code Slash Commands (For Customization)

If you're using **Claude Code**, this project includes convenient slash commands for easy workflow management. Simply type these commands in Claude to execute different parts of the setup:

#### Essential Commands
- `/setup-prerequisites` - Install only prerequisites (Homebrew, Ansible, collections)
- `/check-diff` - Analyze system state and show what changes would be made 
- `/backup-config` - Create a manual backup of your current configuration
- `/restore-config` - Restore from a previous backup (interactive)
- `/customize` - Learn how to ask Claude to customize your Mac setup
- `/run-all` - Run the complete Mac setup with all components
- `/security-review` - Review recent changes for security issues

#### Selective Setup Commands
- `/run-homebrew` - Install Homebrew packages only
- `/run-system` - Configure macOS system preferences only  
- `/run-shell` - Configure shell environment only
- `/run-fonts` - Install fonts and configure terminals
- `/run-cli` - Install additional CLI tools
- `/run-dock` - Configure Dock layout only

These slash commands provide a streamlined way to manage your Mac setup directly through Claude Code, with progress tracking and detailed output.

## ðŸ”„ Backup and Restore System

This setup includes comprehensive backup and restore functionality to make all changes completely reversible.

### Automatic Backups
Every time you run the setup, it automatically creates timestamped backups of:
- **Shell configuration files** (`.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, `.p10k.zsh`) - *Fully restorable*
- **Neovim configuration** (`~/.config/nvim/`) - *Fully restorable*
- **Terminal preferences** (iTerm2, Ghostty) - *Fully restorable*
- **System preferences** (Finder, Dock settings, etc.) - *Mostly restorable*
- **Dock layout reference** - *Manual restoration required*
- Complete restoration instructions

### Manual Backup & Restore Commands
```bash
# Create a manual backup of your current configuration
./backup-config.sh

# Restore from any previous backup (interactive menu)
./restore-config.sh
```

### Backup Storage
- All backups stored in `~/.config-backups/`
- Timestamped directories for multiple restore points
- Each backup includes detailed restoration instructions
- No backup data is ever overwritten

### What You Can Restore
- **Shell & Terminal Settings**: Complete rollback of shell configuration and terminal preferences
- **System Preferences**: Most macOS system settings (some NSGlobalDomain settings may need manual work)
- **Neovim Configuration**: Full restoration of editor setup
- **Multiple restore points**: Access any previous backup
- **Oh My Zsh removal**: Optional removal of zsh framework during restore

### What Stays After Restore
- **Installed Applications**: Homebrew packages and applications remain installed
- **Dock Layout**: Must be manually restored using the saved reference file

This means you can try the configuration changes risk-free - your original settings are preserved, though installed software will remain on your system (which is usually what you want).

## Customization

### Easy Customization with Claude (Recommended)
If you're using **Claude Code**, simply run `/customize` to see examples of how to ask Claude to modify your setup in plain English. No need to edit YAML files manually!

Examples:
- *"Can you add Discord to the dock?"*
- *"I want all browsers at the top of the dock"*
- *"Can you remove Spotify from the setup?"*

### Manual Customization

### Adding Applications
Edit `tasks/homebrew.yml` and add to the appropriate loop section (formulae for CLI tools, casks for GUI apps).

### Modifying System Preferences  
Edit `tasks/system_preferences.yml` following the pattern:
```yaml
- name: Description
  community.general.osx_defaults:
    domain: com.apple.example
    key: PreferenceKey
    type: bool
    value: true
```

### Customizing Dock Layout
Edit `tasks/dock.yml` and modify the dock_items list with applications in desired order.

### Shell Configuration
Edit `tasks/shell_environment.yml` to modify aliases, environment variables, or zsh configuration.

## Development & Testing

### Validation
```bash
# Validate playbook syntax
ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml

# Debug with verbose output
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -v

# Check current vs target package state
comm -23 <(grep -A 50 "Install Homebrew formulae" tasks/homebrew.yml | grep "    - " | sed 's/.*- //' | sort) <(brew list --formula | sort)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
Some system preferences changes may require elevated permissions. The playbook uses `community.general.osx_defaults` which should handle most cases correctly.

### Homebrew Installation
If Homebrew isn't installed, the playbook will install it automatically.

### Application Not Installing
Check if the cask name is correct by searching:
```bash
brew search app-name
```

### Dock Changes Not Applied
The setup uses `dockutil` for reliable Dock management. If issues persist:
```bash
brew install dockutil
dockutil --remove all
# Then re-run /run-dock or ./run.sh --dock
```

## Security Notes

- Safari preferences are disabled due to macOS sandboxing restrictions
- API keys and sensitive information in shell configuration files are excluded from this automation
- You'll need to manually configure application-specific settings and login credentials
- The `/security-review` command helps identify potential security issues in recent changes

## Manual Execution

For users who prefer command-line execution over Claude Code slash commands:

### Check What Would Change (Recommended First Step)
Before running the playbook, see what changes would be made:
```bash
./check-diff.sh
```

### Install Prerequisites Only
Install just the tools needed to run the automation (Homebrew, Ansible, collections):
```bash
./run.sh --prerequisites
```

### Full Setup
Run the complete setup with all configurations:
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Selective Installation
Use the run script with specific options:

- Install only Homebrew packages and applications:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --homebrew
  ```

- Configure only system preferences:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --system
  ```

- Set up only Dock configuration:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --dock
  ```

- Configure only shell environment:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --shell
  ```

- Install only additional CLI tools:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --cli
  ```

- Install fonts and configure terminals:
  ```bash
  ./run.sh --fonts
  ```

### Direct Ansible Execution
You can also run Ansible directly with tags:

```bash
# Run specific components
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "homebrew,apps"
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "system,preferences" 
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "shell,environment"

# Check syntax
ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml

# Dry run to see changes
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check --diff
```
