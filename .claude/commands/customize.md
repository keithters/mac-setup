**🎨 Customization Made Easy**

Want to tailor this Mac setup to your preferences? Just ask Claude! Here are example requests:

## 🍺 **Adding/Removing Apps**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you add Slack and remove Spotify from the setup?"*
- *"I'd like to install Discord and add it to the dock"*
- *"Can you add the `jq` command line tool to the Homebrew packages?"*
- *"Remove Microsoft Teams from the installation"*

## 🎯 **Organizing Your Dock**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you move all browsers to the beginning of the dock?"*
- *"I want all communication apps grouped together"*
- *"Can you remove Google Drive from the dock but keep it installed?"*
- *"Add Notion to the dock next to Obsidian"*

## ⚙️ **System Preferences**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you make the dock auto-hide by default?"*
- *"I want to disable auto-correct and auto-capitalization"*
- *"Can you set the trackpad to not require tap-to-click?"*
- *"Change the default screenshot location to Downloads folder"*

## 🐚 **Shell & Terminal**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you add an alias for `ll` to run `ls -la`?"*
- *"I want to add a custom environment variable for my API key"*
- *"Can you change the default Node.js version to 18 instead of LTS?"*

## 📝 **Development Tools**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you add the Vim plugin for better syntax highlighting?"*
- *"I want to install Python 3.11 specifically"*
- *"Can you add Postman to the development tools?"*

## 💬 **Communication**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you replace Teams with Discord?"*
- *"I want to add Telegram to the communication apps"*
- *"Remove Zoom from the dock but keep it installed"*

## 🎵 **Media & Creative**

**Say this to Claude:**
- *"Can you add Adobe Creative Suite apps?"*
- *"I want VLC player in the media section"*
- *"Add Screen Studio next to other video tools"*

## 🔧 **After Requesting Changes**

Claude will:
1. ✅ **Make the changes** to the configuration files
2. ✅ **Test the syntax** to ensure it's valid
3. ✅ **Tell you what changed** and which command to run
4. ✅ **Commit the changes** to git if you ask

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Be specific**: Instead of "add some apps", say "add Discord, Notion, and VLC"
- **Mention preferences**: "I want browsers at the top" or "group communication apps"
- **Ask for explanations**: "What does this system preference do?"
- **Request testing**: "Can you run `/check-diff` first to show what will change?"
